          Bristol Link is a project which aims to connect University of Bristol

            Let’s say you have a special someone in mind. Find their UOB email
            by typing it into Outlook, and put it into Bristol Link. They’ll
            receive an email from us, telling them that somebody (ahem) wants a
            date, but they aren’t told your name or information.
            <br />
            <br />
            Supposing they are interested, your crush will have to log into Link
            themselves, and enter an email of their own.
            <br />
            <br />
            If the emails (which are encrypted) are a match, you both receive
            confirmation, and it’s the beginning of your love story.
            <br />
            <br />
            Sometimes, it just isn’t meant to be, and if they enter another
            email instead, you will be notified, and can have another shot at
            someone new.
