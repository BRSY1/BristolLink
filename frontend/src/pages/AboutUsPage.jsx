              , we built <b>BristolLink</b>, a matchmaking platform launching
              on Valentine's Day 2025. It's a safe, anonymous, and fun way for
              students to connect with potential matches.
            </p>
            <p className="leading-relaxed">
              BristolLink isn't just another dating appâ€”it's designed with
              students in mind, making it easier to form real connections
              while keeping things respectful and private. We had a blast
              building it, and we hope you all love the app!
